		your network protocol implementation, input/ouput is kept

		class to provide the appropriate API for its protocol implementation.
	@remarks
		Because of the error-prone nature of threads, don't forget to call
		initializeDestruction() at each destructor of derived class. This
		will help to avoid calls to pure virtual calls
