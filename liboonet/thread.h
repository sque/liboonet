            Thread is used as base class to create threads. The idea is to deriver a class that implements
            the function Thread::thread_routine. When you start the thread, it will create a new thread and
            run Thread::thread_routine at the new one.
        @remarks At the derivered class you should take care of shutting down thread before destroying the
            object, otherwise you'll be at the risk of "pure virtual function was called" error.
