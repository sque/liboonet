----
The library is used over 4 years on a couple of closed source projects, so basically it is not under "heavy development" but work is done to clean-up code and document most of its parts. The key of its stability and speed is a VERY rich test-suite that does a deep quality assurance test starting from functions under the hood till simulating some high level usage scenarios.
