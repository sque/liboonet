            thread isn't start, you have to call explicitly start() to create and run a new system thread.
            Each object is able to hold only one thread, to create more thread of same time you have
            to create more objects.
        @remarks At the derivered class you should take care of shutting down thread before destroying the
            object, otherwise you'll have <b>Undefined Behaviour</b> problems
